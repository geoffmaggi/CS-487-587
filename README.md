-------------------------------------
Minibase is a database management system intended for educational use, and is distributed subject to conditions set forth in the [Terms of Distribution](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dbbook/openAccess/Minibase/minibase.notice.html). It has a parser, optimizer, buffer pool manager, storage mechanisms (heap files, secondary indexes based on B+ Trees), and a disk space management system. The goal is not just to have a functional DBMS, but to have a DBMS where the individual components can be studied and implemented by students.
